  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>
    From the very beginning, our story was never just about the two of us —
it was always guided by God’s perfect timing. What started as a simple meeting
slowly unfolded into a journey shaped by prayer, patience, and trust in His plan.
We learned early on that love grows best when it is placed in His hands.

There were seasons when the road felt uncertain, moments when waiting was hard,
and times when we were tested by circumstances beyond our control.
Yet in every step, God remained faithful. Through prayer, we found peace.
Through faith, we found strength. And through His grace, we found each other again
and again, choosing love even when it required courage.

Our relationship taught us that love is not about perfection,
but about commitment — committing to grow, to forgive, and to serve one another
with humility and grace. With God at the center, we learned to listen more,
to love deeper, and to trust that every challenge was preparing us
for something greater.

Like a garden nurtured by His hands, our love was given time to grow.
Rooted in faith and sustained by His promises, it bloomed in ways
we could never have imagined. Each answered prayer, each quiet moment of gratitude,
reminded us that this love is a gift — one we are called to protect and cherish.

Today, as we begin this new chapter, we do so with hearts full of gratitude.
We stand here not by our own strength, but by God’s grace.
With Him leading our marriage, we promise to walk in faith,
to love unconditionally, and to build a home grounded in His word —
a home filled with love, prayer, and unwavering hope for all the days to come.
